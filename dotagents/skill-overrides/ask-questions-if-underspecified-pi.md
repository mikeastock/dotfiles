## Agent-Specific Notes

**ALWAYS** use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask clarifying questions. Use `mode: "single"` for picking one option, `mode: "multi"` for multiple selections with checkboxes, or `mode: "input"` for free text. Set `allowCustom: true` (the default) to let users type a custom response in addition to options.
