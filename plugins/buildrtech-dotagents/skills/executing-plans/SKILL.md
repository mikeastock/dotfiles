# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, verify completion.

**Core principle:** Continuous execution, stop only on blockers.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If clear: Proceed to execution

### Step 2: Execute All Tasks

For each task:
1. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
2. Run verifications as specified
3. If blocked: Stop and ask for help (don't guess)
4. Continue to next task

### Step 3: Complete

After all tasks:
- Run final verifications as specified in the plan
- Summarize completed work and verification output

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has gaps preventing progress
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
