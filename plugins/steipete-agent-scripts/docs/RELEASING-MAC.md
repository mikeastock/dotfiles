# Releasing macOS Apps (Sparkle + GitHub)

Reusable checklist distilled from recent VibeTunnel, Trimmy, and CodexBar releases. Adapt the script names and paths to the target repo before running anything.

> Must read: this master file lives at `~/Projects/agent-scripts/docs/RELEASING-MAC.md`. Open it alongside any repo-local release doc and reconcile differences before starting.

## Scope & Assumptions
- Swift/SwiftUI macOS app shipped outside the App Store, updated via Sparkle (stable + optional prerelease feed).
- Artifacts distributed through GitHub Releases; appcast XML is committed in the repo root.
- Signing uses Developer ID Application cert and ed25519 Sparkle keys; notarization uses App Store Connect API keys.
- Long-running steps (build, notarization, release scripts) should run in tmux/screen to avoid timeouts.

## Prerequisites
- Tools: Xcode 16.4+ (or project minimum), `swift` toolchain, `notarytool`, Sparkle CLI (`sign_update`, `generate_appcast`), `gh`.
- Credentials in env (export once per session):
  - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8`
  - `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` (file-based ed25519 key) and, if used, `SPARKLE_ACCOUNT`
- Repo clean and on main; fast, stable internet for notarization; Apple Developer services green.
- Keep the previous public build installed in `/Applications/<App>.app` to verify the Sparkle update path.

## Versioning Rules
- Single source of truth (e.g., `version.xcconfig` or `Info.plist`): set both `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`.
- Build numbers **must** monotonically increase; Sparkle compares `CFBundleVersion`, not the marketing string. Always bump the build before tagging/publishing and keep the appcast `sparkle:version` in sync.
- Pre-release suffixes (beta/rc) belong in the source-of-truth version **before** running release scripts—avoid double-suffix mistakes.
- For npm/pnpm packages, every beta/rc publish must use a new semver with a suffix (e.g., `1.2.3-beta.1`); npm will not let you overwrite an existing version/tag.
- If there are sibling surfaces (e.g., web UI), align their versions with the macOS app before releasing.
- Immediately after publishing, add a fresh `Unreleased` section and a placeholder for the **next patch version** at the top of the changelog so new changes don’t land in the shipped section.

## Prep: Review History & Changelog
- Verify the latest published release/tag on GitHub (ensure assets are present and match the appcast) **before starting any new release work**.
- Read all commits since that tag (including merges) and skim the diff to capture user-visible changes.
- Curate the changelog before anything else:
  - Focus on user-facing changes only; omit other projects, tests, or internal tweaks unless they materially affect users.
  - Order entries from most interesting/impactful to least.
  - If a feature was added and then removed within the release window, don’t mention it (never shipped).
  - If anything is unclear or contentious, ask the user whether to add/remove it.
- After curation, resort the changelog section for the new version so it matches the above guidance.

## Pre-flight
1) Sync + sanity
```bash
git checkout main && git pull --rebase
git status
```
2) Open the repo’s release doc (if any) and this master file (`~/Projects/agent-scripts/docs/RELEASING-MAC.md`); resolve any conflicts in favor of the current project owner’s direction.
3) Update version + changelog (changelog is the release-notes source).
4) Run the project’s lint/typecheck/tests (e.g., `swiftformat .`, `swiftlint --strict`, `swift test`).
5) Ensure Sparkle key file exists and do a quick test sign:
```bash
echo test > /tmp/sparkle.txt
sign_update -f "$SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE" /tmp/sparkle.txt --account "${SPARKLE_ACCOUNT:-default}"
rm /tmp/sparkle.txt
```
6) Clear stuck DMG volumes if needed:
```bash
for v in /Volumes/*; do [[ $v == */<App>* ]] && hdiutil detach "$v" -force; done
```

## Build, Sign, Notarize
- Prefer the repo’s scripted entry point. Common options:
  - `./scripts/release.sh stable|beta <n>` (handles build → notarize → appcast → release; supports `--resume`/`--status`)
  - `./Scripts/sign-and-notarize.sh` (SwiftPM apps; produces `<App>-<ver>.zip` and staples)
- Typical expectations:
  - Release (or universal) configuration, arm64 at minimum; some projects also ship universal binaries.
- Sign all nested frameworks/XPCs; use the script’s flags—do **not** change `--deep` usage unless the script requires it.
- Notarization via `notarytool` with the exported API key; staple after success.
- Before zipping, strip resource forks/extended attributes from the app (`xattr -cr <App>.app && find <App>.app -name '._*' -delete`) and zip with `ditto --norsrc -c -k --keepParent …` to avoid AppleDouble files that invalidate signatures.
- Avoid `unzip` when testing locally; use `ditto -x -k <zip> /Applications` to prevent `._*` files that break signatures.
- The shared release helpers now always download the enclosure, verify the ed25519 signature, and run `codesign --verify` + `spctl` on the extracted app before publishing—no opt-in flag needed.

### Shared release helpers (release/sparkle_lib.sh)
- `require_clean_worktree` — fail fast if git is dirty.
- `probe_sparkle_key` — quick sign_update probe to ensure the private key is usable.
- `ensure_changelog_finalized <version>` — top changelog section must match the version and not be “Unreleased”.
- `ensure_appcast_monotonic <appcast> <version> <build>` — blocks if the appcast already has that version or if the build is not greater than the latest entry.
- `extract_notes_from_changelog <version> <dest>` — pulls the release-notes slice for reuse in GitHub releases/automation.

## Sparkle Signing & Appcast
**Policy:** Ship full updates only (no deltas). Remove any `<sparkle:deltas>` blocks before publishing the appcast.
1) Generate signature for the shipping artifact (DMG or ZIP):
```bash
sign_update -f "$SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE" path/to/<App>-<ver>.dmg --account "${SPARKLE_ACCOUNT:-default}"
```
2) Update the correct appcast (stable vs prerelease). Ensure:
   - `sparkle:shortVersionString` == marketing version
   - `sparkle:version` == build number (unique and increasing)
   - `sparkle:edSignature` matches the signature you just generated
3) If scripts exist (`generate-appcast.sh`, `make_appcast.sh`, etc.), use them; otherwise edit appcast XML carefully using the existing entry as a template.
4) Validate signatures and feed:
   - Run any helper (`./scripts/validate-sparkle-signature.sh`) if provided.
   - `sign_update -p <zip>` output matches `sparkle:edSignature` in the appcast.
   - Double‑check you used the correct key account: `sign_update --account <app-account> -p <zip>` must match the appcast signature, and the app’s `SUPublicEDKey` must be the public key for that account.
   - `curl -I "<enclosure-url>"` returns 200.
   - `curl "<appcast-url>" | head` shows the new build number/signature/length.
   - Verify update flow using the previous installed build and Sparkle UI.

## GitHub Release & Tag
1) Tag the release after artifacts are ready: `git tag v<version>` (or let the release script tag).
2) Create the GitHub release (pre-release for betas), title `<App> <version>`, body = changelog section for that version.
3) Upload artifacts: DMG/ZIP **and the dSYM archive** (zip it and attach alongside the main artifact for symbolicated crash debugging). Upload the appcast if it is served via Releases. Ensure enclosure URLs in the appcast point to the uploaded assets and return 200/OK. The shared helpers already re-download the enclosure and run codesign/spctl; if the repo ships a release check script (e.g., `Scripts/check-release-assets.sh`), run it after publishing to verify both zip and dSYM are present.
4) Release notes correctness:
   - Header **must be exactly** `<App> <version>` — no prefixes/suffixes.
   - Body must be a copy of the curated changelog for that version (user-facing items only, same order).
   - Confirm every bullet from the changelog is present; nothing extra.
5) Push tags/commits once appcast and release notes are correct.
6) After verifying GitHub uploads, delete local release artifacts (ZIP/DMG/dSYM archives) from the repo workspace—do not leave binaries checked out or staged. Keep only committed source/doc changes.
7) Post-release bookkeeping: edit `CHANGELOG.md` to add `Unreleased` plus the next patch version header (e.g., if 0.5.3 shipped, add `0.5.4 — Unreleased`) so upcoming changes have a landing spot.

## Verification (Definition of Done)
- Download the published artifact, install via `ditto`, launch, and verify:
  - `spctl --assess --type execute --verbose <App>.app`
  - `codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose <App>.app`
  - `stapler validate <App>.app`
- Check Sparkle update path from the previous installed build (stable and prerelease if applicable).
- Curl the appcast and enclosure URL; confirm the new entry, correct build number, and non-404 asset.
- Spot-check artifact size against recent releases to catch bundled dev files.
- For multi-surface apps, confirm version strings match across app UI and companion surfaces.
- GitHub release notes verified: header is `<App> <version>` only; body matches changelog bullets and order.
- Sparkle verification complete: signatures match, appcast entry correct, update tested from prior build when possible.
- Appcast/cache note: if Sparkle still reports the old version, relaunch/wait briefly (feed caching) before retagging; fix build/appcast first. The appcast is the single source of truth for published versions—keep it authoritative; avoid parallel “tracking tables.”

## Final Sign-Off (agent handoff)
- Re-read the GitHub release page: title exactly `<App> <version>`; body matches the curated changelog (no missing/extra bullets).
- Re-open the appcast in a browser/`curl` to confirm the new entry, signature, and enclosure URL are present and 200/OK.
- Confirm local checks: `spctl`, `codesign`, `stapler` on the downloaded artifact; app launches; update path works from previous build.
- Log any deviations or manual fixes (e.g., regenerated signature) in the task notes before handing off.

## Recovery / Resume
- If a scripted release stops mid-flight, rerun with `--resume` or consult any `.release-state` the script writes.
- After notarization success but before publish, you can recover manually:
  1) Create DMG/ZIP if missing (`./scripts/create-dmg.sh` or `./Scripts/package_app.sh`).
  2) Sign with Sparkle (`sign_update -f …`).
  3) Manually edit appcast with the new signature.
  4) Create/repair the GitHub release and push appcast changes.
