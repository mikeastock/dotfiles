## Overview

Review and fix Swift Concurrency issues in Swift 6.2+ codebases by applying actor isolation, Sendable safety, and modern concurrency patterns with minimal behavior changes.

## Workflow

### 1. Triage the issue

- Capture the exact compiler diagnostics and the offending symbol(s).
- Identify the current actor context (`@MainActor`, `actor`, `nonisolated`) and whether a default actor isolation mode is enabled.
- Confirm whether the code is UI-bound or intended to run off the main actor.

### 2. Apply the smallest safe fix

Prefer edits that preserve existing behavior while satisfying data-race safety.

Common fixes:
- **UI-bound types**: annotate the type or relevant members with `@MainActor`.
- **Protocol conformance on main actor types**: make the conformance isolated (e.g., `extension Foo: @MainActor SomeProtocol`).
- **Global/static state**: protect with `@MainActor` or move into an actor.
- **Background work**: move expensive work into a `@concurrent` async function on a `nonisolated` type or use an `actor` to guard mutable state.
- **Sendable errors**: prefer immutable/value types; add `Sendable` conformance only when correct; avoid `@unchecked Sendable` unless you can prove thread safety.
