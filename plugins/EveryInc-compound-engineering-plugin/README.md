A Claude Code plugin marketplace featuring the **Compound Engineering Plugin** — tools that make each unit of engineering work easier than the last.

## Claude Code Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
/plugin install compound-engineering
```

## OpenCode + Codex (experimental) Install

This repo includes a Bun/TypeScript CLI that converts Claude Code plugins to OpenCode and Codex.

```bash
# convert the compound-engineering plugin into OpenCode format
bunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to opencode

# convert to Codex format
bunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to codex
```

Local dev:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts install ./plugins/compound-engineering --to opencode
```

OpenCode output is written to `~/.opencode` by default, with `opencode.json` at the root and `agents/`, `skills/`, and `plugins/` alongside it.
Both provider targets are experimental and may change as the formats evolve.
Codex output is written to `~/.codex/prompts` and `~/.codex/skills`, with each Claude command converted into both a prompt and a skill (the prompt instructs Codex to load the corresponding skill). Generated Codex skill descriptions are truncated to 1024 characters (Codex limit).

## Workflow

```
Plan → Work → Review → Compound → Repeat
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/workflows:plan` | Turn feature ideas into detailed implementation plans |
| `/workflows:work` | Execute plans with worktrees and task tracking |
| `/workflows:review` | Multi-agent code review before merging |
| `/workflows:compound` | Document learnings to make future work easier |

Each cycle compounds: plans inform future plans, reviews catch more issues, patterns get documented.

## Philosophy

**Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier—not harder.**

Traditional development accumulates technical debt. Every feature adds complexity. The codebase becomes harder to work with over time.

Compound engineering inverts this. 80% is in planning and review, 20% is in execution:
- Plan thoroughly before writing code
- Review to catch issues and capture learnings
- Codify knowledge so it's reusable
- Keep quality high so future changes are easy
