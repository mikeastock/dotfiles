### Added
- **Multi-agent queue detection**: When another interview is active, new interviews print URL instead of auto-opening browser, preventing focus stealing
- **Session heartbeat system**: Browser sends heartbeat every 5s; server tracks active sessions
- **Abandoned interview recovery**: Questions saved to `~/.pi/interview-recovery/` on timeout or stale detection
- **Server watchdog**: Detects lost heartbeats (60s grace) and saves recovery before closing
- **Tab close detection**: Best-effort cancel via `pagehide` + `sendBeacon` API
- **Reload protection**: Cmd+R / F5 detected to prevent false cancel on refresh
- **Queued interview toast**: Active interviews show a top-right toast with a dropdown to open queued sessions
- **Queued tool panel output**: Queued interview details render in the tool result panel with a single-line transcript summary
- **Sessions endpoint**: `GET /sessions` returns active/waiting sessions for in-form queue UI
- "Other..." text input option for single/multi select questions
  - Keyboard selection (Enter/Space) auto-focuses the text input
  - Value restoration from localStorage
- Session status bar at top of form
  - Shows cwd path with `~` home directory normalization (cross-platform)
  - Git branch detection via `git rev-parse`
  - Short session ID for identification
- Dynamic document title: `projectName (branch) | sessionId` for tab identification
- `--bg-active-tint` CSS variable for theme-aware active question styling
- Recovery file auto-cleanup (files older than 7 days)

### Changed
- Active question focus styling uses gradient background tint instead of border-only
- Path normalization moved server-side using `os.homedir()` for cross-platform support
- Session registration uses upsert pattern (handles re-registration after prune)
- Cancel endpoint accepts `reason` field: "timeout", "user", or "stale"
- Queue toast position moved to top-right with compact layout

### Fixed
- "Other" option keyboard selection now focuses text input instead of advancing to next question
- "Other" option accepts typing immediately when focused via keyboard
- Light mode active question gradient visibility (increased tint opacity)
- Question focus scroll uses nearest positioning to avoid jarring jumps
- Server-side timeout only starts when browser auto-opens (not for queued interviews)
- `formatTimeAgo` handles negative timestamps (clock skew)
- Race conditions prevented via `completed` flag on server
- Duplicate cancel requests prevented via `cancelSent` flag on client

  - Optional toggle hotkey (e.g., `mod+shift+l`) with localStorage persistence
