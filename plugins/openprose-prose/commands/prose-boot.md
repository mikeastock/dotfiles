2. Search for any `.prose` files in the current directory
3. If first time:
   - Welcome the user to OpenProse
   - Ask about telemetry preferences
   - Show available examples from the plugin's examples/ directory
4. If returning user:
   - Show any existing `.prose` files found
   - Offer to run one or create a new workflow
