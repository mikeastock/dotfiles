OpenProse is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. We make no guarantees about:

- Reliability or availability

**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:**

The OpenProse authors and contributors shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from:

- Your use or inability to use OpenProse
- Any actions taken by AI agents spawned through OpenProse
- Any outputs, decisions, or consequences of agent sessions
- Data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access
- Any errors, bugs, or unexpected behavior

## User Responsibility

**You are solely responsible for:**

1. **Agent Operations**: All actions performed by AI agents you spawn through OpenProse, including any consequences of those actions
2. **Code Review**: Reviewing and understanding any `.prose` programs before execution
3. **Output Verification**: Verifying all outputs and not relying on agent outputs without human review
4. **Access Control**: Ensuring appropriate permissions and access controls for agent operations

## AI Platform Terms

Your use of OpenProse is also subject to the terms of service of your underlying AI assistant platform (Claude Code, Codex, etc.). You are responsible for compliance with those terms.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the OpenProse authors and contributors from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of OpenProse or violation of these terms.

## Modifications

We may modify these terms at any time. Continued use after modifications constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

## Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of the project maintainer, without regard to conflict of law principles.
