# File-System State Management

This document describes how the OpenProse VM tracks execution state using **files in the `.prose/` directory**. This is one of two state management approaches (the other being in-context state in `in-context.md`).

## Overview

File-based state persists all execution artifacts to disk. This enables:

- **Inspection**: See exactly what happened at each step
- **Resumption**: Pick up interrupted programs
- **Long-running workflows**: Handle programs that exceed context limits
- **Debugging**: Trace through execution history

**Key principle:** Files are inspectable artifacts. The directory structure IS the execution state.

### Run ID Format

Format: `{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}-{random6}`

Example: `20260115-143052-a7b3c9`

No "run-" prefix needed—the directory name makes context obvious.

### Segment Numbering

Segments use 3-digit zero-padded numbers: `captain-001.md`, `captain-002.md`, etc.

If a program exceeds 999 segments, extend to 4 digits: `captain-1000.md`.

---

## File Formats

### `.prose/.env`

Simple key=value configuration file:

```env
OPENPROSE_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/prose
```

---

### `state.md` — Append-Only Execution Log

The state file is an **append-only log** of execution events. The VM appends entries as execution progresses rather than rewriting the entire file after each statement.

**Only the VM writes this file.** Subagents never modify `state.md`.

**Key principle:** The VM's conversation history is the primary execution state. The state file exists for resumption and debugging, not as the source of truth during normal execution.

#### Format

```markdown
# run:20260115-143052-a7b3c9 feature-implementation.prose

1→ research ✓
2→ ∥start a,b,c
2a→ a ✓
2b→ b ✓
2c→ c ✓
2→ ∥done
3→ loop:1/5
3→ synthesis ✓
3→ loop:2/5 exit(**complete**)
4→ captain ✓
---end 2026-01-15T14:35:22Z
```

#### Event Markers

| Marker | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `N→ name ✓` | Statement N completed, binding written | `1→ research ✓` |
| `N→ ✓` | Anonymous session completed | `5→ ✓` |
| `N→ ∥start a,b,c` | Parallel block started with branches | `2→ ∥start a,b,c` |
| `Na→ name ✓` | Parallel branch completed | `2a→ a ✓` |
| `N→ ∥done` | Parallel block joined | `2→ ∥done` |
| `N→ loop:I/M` | Loop iteration I of max M | `3→ loop:2/5` |
| `N→ loop:I/M exit(reason)` | Loop exited | `3→ loop:3/5 exit(**done**)` |
| `N→ block:name#ID` | Block invocation started | `4→ block:process#43` |
| `N→ #ID done` | Block invocation completed | `4→ #43 done` |
| `N→ ✗ error` | Statement failed | `5→ ✗ timeout` |
| `N→ retry:A/M` | Retry attempt A of max M | `5→ retry:2/3` |
| `---end TIMESTAMP` | Program completed | `---end 2026-01-15T14:35:22Z` |
| `---error TIMESTAMP msg` | Program failed | `---error 2026-01-15T14:35:22Z timeout` |

#### When the VM Writes

The VM appends to `state.md`:

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Statement completes | Append completion marker |
| Parallel starts/joins | Append parallel markers |
| Loop iteration/exit | Append loop marker |
| Block invoke/complete | Append block markers |
| Error occurs | Append error marker |
| Program ends | Append end marker |

**Note:** The VM does NOT rewrite the entire file. Each write is a single line append, keeping token generation minimal.

#### Resumption

To resume an interrupted run, the VM:

1. Reads `state.md` to find the last completed statement
2. Scans `bindings/` directory for existing outputs
3. Continues from the next statement

The append-only format makes this straightforward—find the last line, determine position.

---

### `bindings/{name}.md`

All named values (input, output, let, const) are stored as binding files.

```markdown
# research

kind: let

source:
```prose
let research = session: researcher
  prompt: "Research AI safety"
```

---

AI safety research covers several key areas including alignment,
robustness, and interpretability. The field has grown significantly
since 2020 with major contributions from...
```

**Structure:**
- Header with binding name
- `kind:` field indicating type (input, output, let, const)
- `source:` code snippet showing origin
- `---` separator
- Actual value below

**The `kind` field distinguishes:**

| Kind | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `input` | Value received from caller |
| `output` | Value to return to caller |
| `let` | Mutable variable |
| `const` | Immutable variable |

### Anonymous Session Bindings

Sessions without explicit output capture still produce results:

```prose
session "Analyze the codebase"   # No `let x = ...` capture
```

These get auto-generated names with an `anon_` prefix:

- `bindings/anon_001.md`
- `bindings/anon_002.md`
- etc.

This ensures all session outputs are persisted and inspectable.

---

### Scoped Bindings (Block Invocations)

When a binding is created inside a block invocation, it's scoped to that execution frame to prevent collisions across recursive calls.

**Naming convention:** `{name}__{execution_id}.md`

Examples:
- `bindings/result__43.md` — binding `result` in execution_id 43
- `bindings/parts__44.md` — binding `parts` in execution_id 44

**File format with execution scope:**

```markdown
# result

kind: let
execution_id: 43

source:
```prose
let result = session "Process chunk"
```

---

Processed chunk into 3 sub-parts...
```

**Scope resolution:** The VM resolves variable references by checking:
1. `{name}__{current_execution_id}.md`
2. `{name}__{parent_execution_id}.md`
3. Continue up the call stack
4. `{name}.md` (root scope)

The first match wins.

**Example directory for recursive calls:**

```
bindings/
├── data.md              # Root scope input
├── result__1.md         # First process() invocation
├── parts__1.md          # Parts from first invocation
├── result__2.md         # Recursive call (depth 2)
├── parts__2.md          # Parts from depth 2
├── result__3.md         # Recursive call (depth 3)
└── ...
```

---

### Agent Memory Files

#### `agents/{name}/memory.md`

The agent's current accumulated state:

```markdown
# Agent Memory: captain

## Current Understanding

The project is implementing a REST API for user management.
Architecture uses Express + PostgreSQL. Test coverage target is 80%.

## Decisions Made

- 2026-01-15: Approved JWT over session tokens (simpler stateless auth)
- 2026-01-15: Set 80% coverage threshold (balances quality vs velocity)

## Open Concerns

- Rate limiting not yet implemented on login endpoint
- Need to verify OAuth flow works with new token format
```

#### `agents/{name}/{name}-NNN.md` (Segments)

Historical records of each invocation, flattened in the same directory:

```markdown
# Segment 001

timestamp: 2026-01-15T14:32:15Z
prompt: "Review the research findings"

## Summary

- Reviewed: docs from parallel research session
- Found: good coverage of core concepts, missing edge cases
- Decided: proceed with implementation, note gaps for later
- Next: review implementation against identified gaps
```

---

## Who Writes What

| File | Written By |
|------|------------|
| `state.md` | VM only |
| `bindings/{name}.md` | Subagent |
| `agents/{name}/memory.md` | Persistent agent |
| `agents/{name}/{name}-NNN.md` | Persistent agent |

The VM orchestrates; subagents write their own outputs directly to the filesystem. **The VM never holds full binding values—it tracks file paths.**

---

## Subagent Output Writing

When the VM spawns a session, it tells the subagent where to write output.

### For Regular Sessions

```
When you complete this task, write your output to:
  .prose/runs/20260115-143052-a7b3c9/bindings/research.md

Format:
# research

kind: let

source:
```prose
let research = session: researcher
  prompt: "Research AI safety"
```

---

[Your output here]
```

### For Persistent Agents (resume:)

```
Your memory is at:
  .prose/runs/20260115-143052-a7b3c9/agents/captain/memory.md

Read it first to understand your prior context. When done, update it
with your compacted state following the guidelines in primitives/session.md.

Also write your segment record to:
  .prose/runs/20260115-143052-a7b3c9/agents/captain/captain-003.md
```

### What Subagents Return to the VM

After writing output, the subagent returns a **confirmation message**—not the full content:

**Root scope (outside block invocations):**
```
Binding written: research
Location: .prose/runs/20260115-143052-a7b3c9/bindings/research.md
Summary: AI safety research covering alignment, robustness, and interpretability with 15 citations.
```

**Inside block invocation (include execution_id):**
```
Binding written: result
Location: .prose/runs/20260115-143052-a7b3c9/bindings/result__43.md
Execution ID: 43
Summary: Processed chunk into 3 sub-parts for recursive processing.
```

The VM records the location and continues. It does NOT read the file—it passes the reference to subsequent sessions that need the context.

---

## Imports Recursive Structure

Imported programs use the **same unified structure recursively**:

```
.prose/runs/{id}/imports/{handle}--{slug}/
├── program.prose
├── state.md
├── bindings/
│   └── {name}.md
├── imports/                    # Nested imports go here
│   └── {handle2}--{slug2}/
│       └── ...
└── agents/
    └── {name}/
```

This allows unlimited nesting depth while maintaining consistent structure at every level.

---

## Memory Scoping for Persistent Agents

| Scope | Declaration | Path | Lifetime |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| Execution (default) | `persist: true` | `.prose/runs/{id}/agents/{name}/` | Dies with run |
| Project | `persist: project` | `.prose/agents/{name}/` | Survives runs in project |
| User | `persist: user` | `~/.prose/agents/{name}/` | Survives across projects |
| Custom | `persist: "path"` | Specified path | User-controlled |

---

## VM Update Protocol

After each statement completes, the VM:

1. **Confirms** subagent wrote its output file(s)
2. **Appends** a single-line marker to `state.md`
3. **Continues** to next statement

The VM appends one line per event—it never rewrites the full state file. This keeps token generation minimal during execution.

---

## Resuming Execution

If execution is interrupted, resume by:

1. Reading `.prose/runs/{id}/state.md` — find the last completed marker
2. Scanning `bindings/` directory to confirm existing outputs
3. Continuing from the next statement

The append-only log format makes resumption simple: the last line indicates where execution stopped.
