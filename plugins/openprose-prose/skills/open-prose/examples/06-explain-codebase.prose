# Explain Codebase
# Progressive exploration of an unfamiliar codebase

# Start with the big picture
session "List all directories and key files in this repository. Provide a high-level map of the project structure."

# Understand the entry point
session "Find the main entry point of the application. Explain how the program starts and initializes."

# Trace a key flow
session "Trace through a typical user request from start to finish. Document the key functions and modules involved."

# Document architecture
session "Based on your exploration, write a brief architecture document explaining how the major components fit together."

# Identify patterns
session "What design patterns and conventions does this codebase use? Document any patterns future contributors should follow."
