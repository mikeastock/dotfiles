# Refactor Code
# Systematic refactoring workflow

# Assess current state
session "Analyze the target code and identify code smells: duplication, long functions, unclear naming, tight coupling."

# Plan refactoring
session "Create a refactoring plan. List specific changes in order of priority, starting with the safest changes."

# Ensure test coverage
session "Check test coverage for the code being refactored. Add any missing tests before making changes."

# Execute refactoring
session "Implement the first refactoring from your plan. Make a single focused change."

# Verify behavior
session "Run tests to verify the refactoring preserved behavior. If tests fail, investigate and fix."

# Document changes
session "Update any documentation affected by the refactoring. Add comments explaining non-obvious design decisions."
