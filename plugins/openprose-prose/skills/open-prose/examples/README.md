## The Architect By Simulation Pattern

The architect-by-simulation pattern is for designing systems by "implementing" them through reasoning. Instead of writing code, each phase produces specification documents that the next phase builds upon.

**Key principles:**

1. **Thinking/deduction framework**: "Implement" means reasoning through design decisions
2. **Serial pipeline with handoffs**: Each phase reads previous phase's output
3. **Persistent architect**: Maintains master plan and synthesizes learnings
4. **User checkpoint**: Get plan approval BEFORE executing the pipeline
5. **Simulation as implementation**: The spec IS the deliverable

```prose
# The core pattern
agent architect:
  model: opus
  persist: true
  prompt: "Design by simulating implementation"

# Create master plan with phases
let plan = session: architect
  prompt: "Break feature into design phases"

# User reviews the plan BEFORE the pipeline runs
input user_approval: "User reviews plan and approves"

# Execute phases serially with handoffs
for phase_name, index in phases:
  let handoff = session: phase-executor
    prompt: "Execute phase {index}"
    context: previous_handoffs

  # Architect synthesizes after each phase
  resume: architect
    prompt: "Synthesize learnings from phase {index}"
    context: handoff

# Synthesize all handoffs into final spec
output spec = session: architect
  prompt: "Synthesize all handoffs into final spec"
```

See example 39 for the full implementation.

## The Captain's Chair Pattern

The captain's chair is an orchestration paradigm where a coordinating agent (the "captain") dispatches specialized subagents for all execution. The captain never writes code directly—only plans, coordinates, and validates.

**Key principles:**

1. **Context isolation**: Subagents receive targeted context, not everything
2. **Parallel execution**: Multiple subagents work concurrently where possible
3. **Continuous criticism**: Critic agents review plans and outputs mid-stream
4. **80/20 planning**: 80% effort on planning, 20% on execution oversight
5. **Checkpoint validation**: User approval at key decision points

```prose
# The core pattern
agent captain:
  model: opus
  prompt: "Coordinate but never execute directly"

agent executor:
  model: sonnet
  prompt: "Execute assigned tasks precisely"

agent critic:
  model: sonnet
  prompt: "Review work and find issues"

# Captain plans
let plan = session: captain
  prompt: "Break down this task"

# Parallel execution with criticism
parallel:
  work = session: executor
    context: plan
  review = session: critic
    context: plan

# Captain validates
output result = session: captain
  prompt: "Validate and integrate"
  context: { work, review }
```

See examples 29-31 for full implementations.

## The Recursive Language Model Pattern

Recursive Language Models (RLMs) are a paradigm for handling inputs far beyond context limits. The key insight: treat the prompt as an external environment that the LLM can symbolically interact with, chunk, and recursively process.

**Why RLMs matter:**

- Base LLMs degrade rapidly on long contexts ("context rot")
- RLMs maintain performance on inputs 2 orders of magnitude beyond context limits
- On quadratic-complexity tasks, base models get <0.1% while RLMs achieve 58%

**Key patterns:**

1. **Self-refinement**: Recursive improvement until quality threshold
2. **Divide-and-conquer**: Chunk, process, aggregate recursively
3. **Filter-then-recurse**: Cheap filtering before expensive deep dives
4. **Pairwise aggregation**: Handle O(n²) tasks through batch decomposition

```prose
# The core RLM pattern: recursive block with scope isolation
block process(data, depth):
  # Base case
  if **data is small** or depth <= 0:
    output session "Process directly"
      context: data

  # Recursive case: chunk and fan out
  let chunks = session "Split into logical chunks"
    context: data

  parallel for chunk in chunks:
    do process(chunk, depth - 1)  # Recursive call

  # Aggregate results (fan in)
  output session "Synthesize partial results"
```

**OpenProse advantages for RLMs:**

- **Scope isolation**: Each recursive call gets its own `execution_id`, preventing variable collisions
- **Parallel fan-out**: `parallel for` enables concurrent processing at each recursion level
- **State persistence**: SQLite/PostgreSQL backends track the full call tree
- **Natural aggregation**: Pipelines (`| reduce`) and explicit context passing

See examples 40-43 for full implementations.

## Feature Reference

### Core Syntax

```prose
# Comments
session "prompt"                    # Simple session
let x = session "..."               # Variable binding
const y = session "..."             # Immutable binding
```

### Agents

```prose
agent name:
  model: sonnet                     # haiku, sonnet, opus
  prompt: "System prompt"
  skills: ["skill1", "skill2"]
  permissions:
    read: ["*.md"]
    bash: deny
```

### Parallel

```prose
parallel:                           # Basic parallel
  a = session "A"
  b = session "B"

parallel ("first"):                 # Race - first wins
parallel ("any", count: 2):         # Wait for N successes
parallel (on-fail: "continue"):     # Don't fail on errors
```

### Loops

```prose
repeat 3:                           # Fixed iterations
  session "..."

for item in items:                  # For-each
  session "..."

parallel for item in items:         # Parallel for-each
  session "..."

loop until **condition** (max: 10): # Unbounded with AI condition
  session "..."
```

### Pipelines

```prose
items | map:                        # Transform each
  session "..."
items | filter:                     # Keep matching
  session "..."
items | reduce(acc, x):             # Accumulate
  session "..."
items | pmap:                       # Parallel transform
  session "..."
```

### Error Handling

```prose
try:
  session "..."
catch as err:
  session "..."
finally:
  session "..."

session "..."
  retry: 3
  backoff: "exponential"            # none, linear, exponential

throw "message"                     # Raise error
```

### Conditionals

```prose
if **condition**:
  session "..."
elif **other condition**:
  session "..."
else:
  session "..."
```

### Choice

```prose
choice **criteria**:
  option "Label A":

  option "Label B":
    session "..."
```

### Blocks

block name(param):                  # Define with parameters
  session "... {param} ..."

do name("value")                    # Invoke with arguments
```

### String Interpolation

```prose
let x = session "Get value"
session "Use {x} in prompt"         # Single-line

session """                         # Multi-line
Multi-line prompt with {x}
"""
```
