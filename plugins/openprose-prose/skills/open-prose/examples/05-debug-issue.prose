# Debug an Issue
# Step-by-step debugging workflow

# Understand the problem
session "Read the error message and stack trace. Identify which file and function is causing the issue."

# Gather context
session "Read the relevant source files and understand the code flow that leads to the error."

# Form hypothesis
session "Based on your investigation, form a hypothesis about what's causing the bug. List 2-3 possible root causes."

# Test hypothesis
session "Write a test case that reproduces the bug. This will help verify the fix later."

# Implement fix
session "Implement a fix for the most likely root cause. Explain your changes."

# Verify fix
session "Run the test suite to verify the fix works and doesn't break anything else."
