# Code Review Pipeline
# Review code from multiple perspectives sequentially

# First, understand what the code does
session "Read the files in src/ and provide a brief overview of the codebase structure and purpose."

# Security review
session "Review the code for security vulnerabilities. Look for injection risks, authentication issues, and data exposure."

# Performance review
session "Review the code for performance issues. Look for N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, and blocking operations."

# Maintainability review
session "Review the code for maintainability. Look for code duplication, unclear naming, and missing documentation."

# Synthesize findings
session "Create a unified code review report combining all the findings above. Prioritize issues by severity and provide actionable recommendations."
