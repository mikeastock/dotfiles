# Contributing to OpenProse

Thanks for your interest in contributing to OpenProse! This document outlines how to get involved.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Report bugs** — Open an issue describing what went wrong

- **Submit PRs** — Fix bugs or implement features
- **Share feedback** — Tell us how you're using OpenProse

## Before You Start

### Small Changes

For bug fixes, documentation improvements, or small enhancements — just open a PR. No need to ask first.

### Large Changes

Before investing significant time in a major feature or architectural change, please reach out first. This helps ensure your work aligns with the project direction and doesn't conflict with ongoing development.

Ways to discuss ideas:
- Open a GitHub issue describing your proposal
- Reach out on X/Twitter: [@irl_danB](https://x.com/irl_danB)

This isn't gatekeeping — it's to save you from wasted effort if the change runs counter to something already in progress.

## Submitting a PR

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your change
3. Make your changes
4. Test locally (run example `.prose` programs)
5. Submit the PR with a clear description
