# Tok Speed

Tok Speed displays a small `tok/s` label in each assistant message's hover
action row. The number is visible provider-output speed for that turn: visible
output tokens divided by active assistant-message time. It deliberately
excludes hidden reasoning, commands, tool results, and other host work, so it
answers “how quickly did the provider stream the text I saw?”

The plugin reads BB's provider item lifecycle and visible-message delta events,
plus `thread/tokenUsage/updated`. It uses the running usage total when present,
which avoids double-counting repeated snapshots, and falls back to the latest
snapshot for older event rows. Providers that do not report usable
visible-output usage or completed assistant-message timings simply have no
label. The label's tooltip includes the visible output tokens and usage samples
included in the pooled rate.

BB stores events in batches, so a very short response can have no trustworthy
duration in the event log. Those samples are omitted instead of producing a
misleading rate.

This screenshot is captured from BB's rendered thread UI with seeded local
conversation data, a hovered assistant message, and a live `tok/s` decoration
in the bottom action row.
