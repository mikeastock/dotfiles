// BB Sidebar: a stable, manually ordered replacement for bb's thread list.
// list, and the reference example for `app.slots.experimental_threadList`.
//
// The idea it is built around: the list NEVER re-orders itself. Threads sort
// by creation time, newest first, and hold that place. Status is carried by
// each card, not by position, so the sidebar only moves when you act.
