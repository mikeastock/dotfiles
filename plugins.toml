# plugins.toml - Plugin configuration for AI agent skills and extensions
#
# Each plugin is a table with fully qualified name (owner/repo):
#   url             - Git repository URL (required)
#   commit          - Pinned commit SHA (used to detect upstream updates)
#   skills_path     - Glob pattern(s) to find skills (default: "skills/*")
#   skills          - List of skills to install: ["*"] for all, [] or omit for none
#   skills_skip_agents - Agents that should not receive this plugin's skills (optional)
#   extensions_path - Glob pattern(s) to find extensions (default: "extensions/*.ts")
#   extensions      - List of extensions to install: ["*"] for all, [] or omit for none
#   prompts_path    - Glob pattern(s) to find prompt templates (default: "prompts/*.md")
#   prompts         - List of prompt templates to install: ["*"] for all, [] or omit for none
#   alias           - Optional prefix to prevent name collisions
#
# Plugin directories use hyphen separator: owner/repo -> plugins/owner-repo/
# Plugins are vendored directly (not submodules). Use `make plugin-update` to update.
