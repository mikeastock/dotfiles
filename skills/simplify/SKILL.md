description: Use this skill automatically when you feel your code is ready for human review, and whenever writing or reviewing code comments. Ready means the code works and achieves a stated goal, verified by your own tests and/or, if you deem it necessary, human testing.

Review changes in the current branch, or in the scope the user specifies. Apply these criteria without changing behavior. Only touch code in that scope, and run the relevant existing checks after changes.

## Word choice in code and comments

Variable names, function names, and comments are all prose. Apply Orwell's rules ("Politics and the English Language") to each:

> Never use a long word where a short one will do.
>
> If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
>
> Never use the passive where you can use the active.
>
> Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.

Latinate vocabulary (reconcile, coalesce, normalize, reconciliation) sounds technical and abstract; Anglo-Saxon words (prune, run, watch, stop, drop, walk) are short and physical. Prefer the Saxon word.

### Names

1. **One word per concept, one concept per word.** Keep a vocabulary. If `sync` names "pulling remote changes," it cannot also name "flushing edits to disk;" rename one of them.
2. **Cut words the context already carries.** A module named `workspaceWatcher` does not need `startNativeWorkspaceWatcher`; `watchWorkspace` says the same thing.
3. **A compound name is usually a hedge:**

- ❌ `lastObservedDiskContent` is a specification to defend
- ✅ `baseline` is a readable description

### Comments

State, in plain English, the constraint the code cannot show: why the **non-obvious** exists.

- ✅ If code is complex and the implementation is non-obvious, add a comment.
- ✅ If a function contains complex behaviors or side effects, add a doc comment.
- 🗑️ If a comment narrates change history from the conversation, delete it.
- 🗑️ If a comment restates code whose behavior is self-evident, delete it.

## Code structure

1. **Inverted pyramid.** Within a file, lead with the exported or significant functions and push helpers below them. Don't bury the lead.
2. **Related concepts over monoliths.** Break a large file into modules that each own one concept.
3. **Combine overlapping concepts.** If two types, functions, or constants overlap significantly, merge them. The fewer distinct concepts a reader must hold in their head, the better.
4. **Use shared code.** Common utilities (ex. file path parsing) may exist in the codebase already. Check for library or utility functions before inlining.
5. **Derivability.** If a value can be computed from values already in scope, don't pass or store it separately. Removing derivable state often simplifies signatures, types, and control flow in one move. Example: an `isDirty` parameter that is always `editorContent !== baseline` can be dropped.

## Overfitting

Code must stand on its own. If a change only makes sense to someone who watched it happen (this conversation, this PR), it is overfitted. Write for the reader who arrives with no history.

- If a name or comment needs the conversation to be understood, rewrite it against the codebase's own vocabulary.
- **No backwards compatibility with unshipped code.** Supporting an old signature, alias, or data shape that only existed earlier in the same branch is compatibility with something that was never deployed. Delete the old path and update its callers.
